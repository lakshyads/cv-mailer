Subject: Senior / Lead Software Engineer – Property Finder (Dubai)

Hi Lakshya2,

I’m reaching out regarding the **Senior / Lead Software Engineer** role at **Property Finder (Dubai)**. I currently lead the design and modernization of foundational, cloud-native services used at scale, and I bring hands-on experience owning architecture, performance, and reliability for high-traffic platforms.

At PayPal, I’ve been leading a team of **5 engineers** on core platform services, scaling APIs to handle **125M+ requests per day** while achieving **P95 latencies under 14ms**. I’ve driven system modernization initiatives, introduced multi-vendor strategies, and improved platform reliability and cost efficiency. Previously, I led cloud automation efforts that reduced time-to-market for analytics workloads to **under 3 days** and delivered **$10M+ in cloud cost savings** through provisioning and governance automation.

I enjoy operating at the intersection of architecture, execution, and mentorship, and I’m motivated by building systems that scale with both product growth and engineering teams. I’d welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience could contribute to Property Finder’s platform and long-term technical roadmap.

My resume is attached for your review. Please let me know a convenient time to connect.

Best regards,
**Lakshya Dev Singh**
